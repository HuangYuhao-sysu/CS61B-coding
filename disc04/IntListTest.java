public class IntListTest {
    /**
     * Advantage: We can test the different sub method in class separately.
     * Disadvantage: No.
     */

     /** Answer:
      * Advantages:
        1. Keeps your code organized - each test corresponds to different building blocks of your program.
        2. You can debug your code locally and find which part of your program is not working.
        3. Provides documentation that your program actually words.
        4. Can reduce the amount of test code you need to write because you can reuse code.
      * Disadvantages:
        1. Hard to use for higher-level testing.
